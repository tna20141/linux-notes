FOREWORD
========

This journal is my personal research journal that records questions, answers, discoveries, ideas,
opninions and similar things in the journey to understand the Linux kernel. I didn't start writing
this journal from the beginning, but just sometime after I decided to go for the kernel. The
journal will be very simple (at least at first). The only format to it is that I will keep track
of time (in date) in this journal. The content will be as intuitive as possible, no formal
structure is needed. Now this is supposed to be a (live) journal, so I'm not gonna summerize things
I've learned so far here, because they are more suitable to be in a note.

I started the journal today because I think it's important for the road ahead.

Kinda done with the paging init, moving to actual memory management (chapter 8 of ULK).

I think 64-bit architecture doesn't have ZONE_HIGHMEM because the address space that 64-bit can
handle is just too big, thus it makes no sense to partition the RAM into many zones.

Page frames are allocated in the order of 2, this might be due to the buddy system's mechanism.

Seems like mem_map array contains info about all page frames (fixed sized array), so the code
__va((unsigned long)(page - mem_map)<<12) is possible. I mean the page frame index corresponds to
the linear address.

Page mapping is all about mapping a PAGE FRAME into a LINEAR ADDRESS. What is in the page frame
depends on other things (like a loading routine or an allocation, I guess).

It's often said that in x86, memory beyond the 896MB mark is high memory. I wondered if the 128MB
beyond that belonged to high memory or still inside the kernel address space. A logical answer is
that the 128MB of the kernel is just the LINEAR address space, not the physical one. So the 128MB
linear address space is used by the kernel for the stuff it's supposed to be used for, and the
128MB physical address space beyond the 896MB mark is genuine high memory.

I'll come back to chapter 3 (Processes) for now. I think reading sequentially is still better.

About handling process wait queues. The book often quotes the following code snippet:
if (!condition)
	schedule();
Doesn't this contain a potential race condition? I'm pretty sure they took care of this (since this
is big stuff), but I don't know how.

I think a process switch doesn't need to save GPRs (general purpose registers) because (most of)
these are preserved over a function call anyway. Other things like PGD addresses (in cr3) are stored
in process descriptor, so no need to save them either.

If the CLONE_THREAD flag is set, tsk->exit_signal is initialized to -1, which means that the (child)
process won't send any signal to its parent when it terminates. This makes sense, since only the
last member of the thread group (usually, the thread group leader) gets to send the exit signal to
the parent. And since the CLONE_THREAD flag is specified, the in-dicussed process is inserted into
its parent's thread group, which means it won't be a thread group leader.

The interrupt handler can't use the interrupted process as its backing process (in other words,
its "schedule agent") for rescheduling, probably because the interrupted process is already busy
saving its states from the interrupt handler, it can't also contain the interrupt handler's states.
It cant be thought of as follow: the interrupted process is already annoyed that the interrupt
handler takes up its kernel stack, it won't be any kinder as to back the handler up for
rescheduling. Also making interrupt handlers sleepable is gonna get things very much complicated.

I still don't know exactly why interrupt handler can't sleep (maybe it shouldn't, but there's no
concrete reason why it CAN'T).

I think I know why. The interrupt handler has NOTHING TO DO with the process. Aside from using the
same stack (sometimes they don't even do that), they should be as decoupled as possible. Putting
the process to sleep because of the handler (when the process itself is perfectly runnable) is...
bad, I supposed. So, interrupt handler shouldn't be blocked.

I guess that makes Robert's explanation somewhat reasonable (with all that "no backing process" and
"how would it reschedule?" stuff). But Daniel & Marco's "can't block because they are nested"
doesn't seem to relate to this. Maybe they mean that an inner handler sleeping might block the outer
handler as well, and that's not good.

OK, we're done here. This is satisfying enough for me (and for now).

I'm at the beginning of chapter 5 (about kernel preemption). I figure the kernel can allocate time
to processes by means of hardware timer. When a timer expires, it issues an interrupt to the CPU,
whose purpose is to inform the kernel that the allocated time is up and a new process should be
scheduled to run next.

DAMN! All this time I thought unlikely(cond) equals (!cond), and from
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/109710/likely-unlikely-macros-in-the-linux-kernel it says that
unlikely(cond) essentially means (cond). likely or unlikely is just for telling if the condition
is likely to happen or not, it has nothing to do with the real logic. So I could've mistaken a lot
of stuff along the way because of this. Really, damn!!!

And today is her birthday...

Feb 15th 2014

It's been a while since I last used this journal.

I've decided that this journal is for writing logs about TODO stuff, events,... and won't include
much (if any) technical knowledge or information. Those will be documented in other text files.
Ok, now continues the normal logging.

Tomorrow, I need to examine do_exit() code carefully.

========

Feb 16th 2014

Will have to come back to do_exit() later, when I will have understood signals and the whole
process structure.

I created a github repos for these notes today. Just feel like doing it.
